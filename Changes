History of Win32::API perl extension.

2012-07-23  Win32::API v0.69    ELIN

   - update for the structure array and the array of 2bytes or more.

   - $VERSION string fix.

2012-04-10  Win32::API v0.68    Cosimo

   - Temporarily skip RT#53914 related Callback test that's crashing
     for everyone and CPAN testers too.

2012-02-14  Win32::API v0.67    Cosimo

   - Fix a problem in 0.66 that prevented successful build and install
     of Win32::API. In other words, v0.66 is unusable! Stay away.
     Thanks CPAN testers!

2012-02-13  Win32::API v0.66    Cosimo

   - RT#74578 about structs alignment calculation should be fixed.
     Thanks to Douglas Wilson (DOUGW) and Reini Urban!

2012-02-12  Win32::API v0.65    Cosimo

   - No changes other than passing all files through perltidy

2011-08-28  Win32::API v0.64    Cosimo

   - Small improvement to Makefile.PLs to build or not build
     the Callback module depending on architecture (64 bit archs
     by default don't build Callback, it's known to fail tests).

2011-07-19  Win32::API v0.63    kmx

   - Fix for the strawberry perl 5.14.1/x64
     the upgraded gcc toolchain (4.4.6) uses different underscoring

2011-03-26  Win32::API v0.62    Cosimo

   - Skip Callback/t/03_Jim_Shaw.t test as it's reported failing
     on both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

2011-03-22  Win32::API v0.61    Cosimo

   - Fixed build process that was failing due to missing *.h
     and *.asm files in the MANIFEST

2011-03-19  Win32::API v0.60    Cosimo

   - Added *preliminary* x64, 64-bit, support.
     Now the test dll also ships with a x64 build
     and an updated VS solution file with Release and Debug x64 builds.

     Many fantastic people helped with 64 bits support:
     https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=55660

   - Fixed RT #48006
     (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=48006)

   - Added a minimal TODO file, so I can remember where I left off

2009-07-02  Win32::API v0.59     Cosimo

   - Fixed compilation with gcc/mingw 4.4.0, thanks to Reini Urban.
     (RT#47398, https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47398)

2009-01-17  Win32::API v0.58     Cosimo

   No significant updates for normal users.
   Developers instead please update to v0.58.
   Now you can play with the API_test.dll.

   - Test DLL MSVC project files updated to MSVC 2008.
     Now I will be able to add new tests (__cdecl)
   - General cleanup of tests and removed some warnings

2008-10-16  Win32::API v0.57     Cosimo

   - Re-added source code for the API_test DLL.
     Still needs to be adapted to be built with GCC/MinGW
     and different Makes, but it's a start.

2008-10-03  Win32::API v0.56     Cosimo

   - RT#39730 (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39730)

     Now passing a Perl undefined value to an API imported with
     a prototype, automatically turns it into a NULL value.
     Thanks to Ikegami for his bug report and patch.
     Added a new test case.

   - Fixed MSVC compiler version detection in Win32::API::Test.
     Thanks to Salvador Ortiz Garcia (sog at msg com mx)

   - Fixed several compilation warnings on `Callback.xs'

   - Started some work to support double*. Halfway through.

2008-03-23  Win32::API v0.55     Cosimo

   - Integrated patch from Salvador Ortiz Garcia (sog at msg com mx)
     which fixes RT #14660. There was a bug in arguments type packing
     unpacking of char* (and other pointer types).

2008-03-04  Win32::API v0.54     Cosimo

   - Try to clean up this big OS check mess.

2008-03-02  Win32::API v0.53     Cosimo

   - Devel::AssertOS came out unauthorized.
   - META.yml was outdated and wrong.

2008-03-01  Win32::API v0.52     Cosimo

   - Devel::AssertOS was not properly set up in 0.51.

2008-03-01  Win32::API v0.51     Cosimo

   - Cleaned up API.pm pod docs and clearly stated Win32::API license
   - Fixed $$/pid tests for Cygwin
   - Now uses Devel::AssertOS to check that we are on a Win32 or Cygwin
     system. This should ease the work of CPAN testers.

2008-02-23  Win32::API v0.50     Cosimo

   - Fixed RT #31702 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=31702)
     Thanks to RUrban for supplying the fix.

2008-02-20  Win32::API v0.49     Cosimo

   - Fixed the stack cleanup assembler statements for GCC in API.xs, I hope.
   - Fixed a Borland C macro definition in API.xs
   - Fixed META.yml (stupid me)

2008-02-20  Win32::API v0.48     Cosimo

   - Finally applied the cdecl/stdcall patch available since long time
     from http://www.xs4all.nl/~itsme/projects/perl/.
     Now Win32::API *can* work with cdecl DLLs.
     Fixes RT #32424 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=32424)
       and RT #24685 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=24685)
     Thanks to Willem Jan Hengeveld (itsme at xs4all.nl) for your great work.
     Thanks to JimK for a test case and to BrowserUk and others at PerlMonks
     for providing me useful information and complaints. :-)

     However, still missing some GCC assembler magic for stack cleanup.
     Any help?

   - Clarified licensing info. Yes, Win32::API is available with
     GPL 2 / Artistic license.

2007-11-12  Win32::API v0.47     Cosimo

   - Nothing exciting. Fixed warning on DATA filehandle.
     Reported by Dmitri Karasik. Build passed on Windows Vista.
     Fixes RT #30674 (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30674)

2006-12-23  Win32::API v0.46     Cosimo

   - Test suite now passes on MSVC6, MSVC7, GCC/MinGW and Cygwin.
     A lot of skips and segfaults on doubles/floats should be examined,
     though. But now it's possible to cleanly install from CPAN!

   - API_test.dll building phase has been removed. Now there is only
     a prebuilt version of it, suitable for all compilers to link and
     use, I hope.

     Why does Cygwin gcc compile an entirely different API_test.dll?
     I checked the tdump of msvc and gcc and the gcc version is
     missing all the kernel32 imports. I don't know why this happens.

   - Removed README.txt file. Now there's only README.

2006-11-29  Win32::API v0.45     Cosimo

   - What a mess! Restored GCC/MinGW compile that broke with that
     damned assembler macros...

2006-11-28  Win32::API v0.44     Cosimo

   - Fixed compile under MSVC broken with GCC/MinGW last changes.

2006-11-28  Win32::API v0.43     Cosimo

   - Now Win32::API should cleanly *compile* on GCC / MinGW
     environment. This has been tested only Vanilla Perl and
     only with Microsoft nmake.
     Test suite does not work with GCC. You can only test that
     Win32::API extension works running manually the t\99_GetProcess.t
     test script.
     This improvement comes thanks to the 0.42 patches I found
     and collected from the internet, though I don't know who
     is the guy that wrote them first. Anyway, thank you!

   - There are problems with current ExtUtils::MakeMaker (6.31 and
     also blead, I believe) version and dmake generated Makefiles.
     I'm trying to understand what to do here.

   - Win32::API::Type now doesn't have a INIT block anymore, that
     seems to be the cause of all evils on this module.
     Please you out there report your findings on this.

   - Last but not least. Current maintainer of Win32::API is now
     Cosimo Streppone (me), cosimo at cpan.org. I'm not very
     skilled on Win32 development, but I'm trying to to work out the
     CPAN bugs queue. Thanks to Aldo for handing me his wonderful
     work maintainance.
